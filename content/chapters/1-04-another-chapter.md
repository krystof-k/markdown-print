# Another chapter

This is a text with footnote.^[â€¦and this the inline footnote itself.]

You can use also footnote identifiers, which separates the footnote content.[^footnote]

[^footnote]: It's a good thing that in that case, you can use multiple paragraphs within the footnote.

    Just don't forget to indent other paragraphs by four spaces.
